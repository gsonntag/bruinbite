How to get backend up and running:

Install Postgres (on macOS, I have homebrew so I installed postgresql and docker-compose and am running it that way)

Install golang-migrate (with homebrew: it's just `brew install golang-migrate`)

Run the SQL init script in the backend/ folder (ex below):
gavin@gavins-mbp backend % migrate \                                                                                                    
-path ./migrations/ \
-database "$DATABASE_URL" \
up

where DATABASE_URL is your full database connection URL, starting with "postgres://" and specifying username, password, and database name
** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SET THIS ENV VAR because the go code references it

Use `go run main.go`!
You can test the test gateway with `curl http://localhost:8080/test`
